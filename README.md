# imageenhancementmorphsegment
this repo is to upload image processing enhancement and morphing
The main goal of this segmentation was to highlight that a bone has been replaced. If we look at the thresholded image or morphed opening image in the range 50:180,300:340 we can guarantee that the right leg bone from the original image is indeed a replaced bone.
The entire segment is yellow while in the equivalent regionfor the left bone approximately pixrls 50:180,80:110 shows that the entire segment is maroon.
Hence this change in colour identifies that there is some form of dis-functioning in the image. This purely implies that the right leg bone has been modified.
